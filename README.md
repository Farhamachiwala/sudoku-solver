# Sudoku Solver

With the help of this program, you can get the solution of either 4x4 or 9x9 sudoku grids easily!

## How to enter data

In the main function, there is a variable called *board*. You need to simply enter your values in this list

Each row of the sudoku grid is a list in the bigger list

Replace blanks by the number 0

(There are already two sample boards - one 4x4 and one 9x9, you could just replace the values in either of those boards with the values in your grid)

*Note: In this program, I am assuming that the grid entered is a **valid** 4x4 or 9x9 grid.
       You can only find the answer of one board at a time, so comment out the other board when finding the solution of one board*
